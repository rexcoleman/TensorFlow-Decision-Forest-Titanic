## 3. Model Selection and Training

### 3.1 Overview of TensorFlow Decision Forests

TensorFlow Decision Forests is a powerful library for training, evaluating, and serving decision forest models. It provides implementations of various decision tree algorithms, including Random Forests and Gradient Boosted Trees, which are highly effective for both classification and regression tasks. This section provides an overview of the TensorFlow Decision Forests library, its features, and its advantages.

### 3.2 Baseline Model Training

The baseline model serves as the initial benchmark for evaluating the performance of the decision forest model. The steps involved in training the baseline model include:
- **Model Initialization**: Setting up the initial model using default hyperparameters.
- **Training**: Fitting the model to the training data.
- **Evaluation**: Assessing the model's performance on the testing set using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

### 3.3 Improved Model Training

Building on the baseline model, improved model training involves optimizing the model to enhance its performance. This includes:
- **Feature Selection**: Identifying and selecting the most relevant features to reduce overfitting and improve model accuracy.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Systematically exploring different hyperparameter values to find the optimal settings for the model.
- **Cross-Validation**: Implementing cross-validation techniques to ensure the model's robustness and generalizability.

### 3.4 Hyperparameter Tuning

Hyperparameter tuning is a crucial step in improving model performance. This involves:
- **Grid Search**: Exhaustively searching through a specified subset of hyperparameters to identify the best combination.
- **Random Search**: Randomly sampling hyperparameters from a defined space and selecting the best performing set.
- **Bayesian Optimization**: Using probabilistic models to select hyperparameters that maximize the model's performance.

### 3.5 Model Ensembling

Model ensembling involves combining multiple models to improve overall performance. Techniques used in this project include:
- **Voting Ensemble**: Combining predictions from multiple models and using a majority vote or averaging to make the final prediction.
- **Stacking**: Training a meta-model on the predictions of several base models to achieve better performance.
- **Bagging and Boosting**: Implementing methods like Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating) and Boosting to reduce variance and bias in the model.

### 4.3 Impact of Each Hyperparameter on Model Performance

The impact of each hyperparameter on model performance was assessed by evaluating the accuracy and loss metrics for different configurations:

- **min_examples**: A higher value can reduce overfitting but may miss finer patterns in the data.
- **categorical_algorithm**: The choice between "CART" and "RANDOM" affects how categorical features are handled, influencing model complexity and performance.
- **growing_strategy**: "LOCAL" strategy focuses on depth, while "BEST_FIRST_GLOBAL" focuses on node count, both impacting the model's ability to generalize.
    - **max_depth**: Deeper trees can capture more complex patterns but are prone to overfitting.
    - **max_num_nodes**: More nodes allow for finer decision boundaries but increase model complexity.
- **shrinkage**: Controls the learning rate; lower values prevent overfitting but may require more iterations.
- **num_candidate_attributes_ratio**: A higher ratio can improve performance by considering more features but increases computation.
- **split_axis**: Different strategies for splitting can capture different types of feature interactions.
    - **sparse_oblique_normalization**: Impacts the normalization technique used for oblique splits.
    - **sparse_oblique_weights**: Determines whether weights are binary or continuous.
    - **sparse_oblique_num_projections_exponent**: Affects the number of projections considered for sparse oblique splits.
